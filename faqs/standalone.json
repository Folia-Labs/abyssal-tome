If another card, like [Sharpshooter](/card/60327) or [Delilah O'Rourke](/card/06281), references the evade value of something with a '-', like Swamp Leech or [Vulnerable Heart](/card/85043), is it treated as 0 for those purposes as well? Or is the ability just unable to fire? What about investigating the [Hidden Tunnel](/card/08630) in [City of the Elder Things](/card/08621) (for something like [Searching for Izzie](/card/02011), [Call of the Unknown](/card/04009), or [Buried Secrets](/card/08009))? **A:** After re-examining these cards and the direction our game has taken, we are going to override the previous ruling. Even if Swamp Leech were blanked with Mind Wipe, its Evade value would still be a “-“, which can be thought of as “null” or a “non-number.” You could not use this non-number as the basis for a skill test with Sharpshooter. It’s, as you said, unable to fire. This also means that you could not investigate at Hidden Tunnel.",
