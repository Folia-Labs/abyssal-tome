However, if you heal horror from several different cards, even from a single effect, you can trigger Carolyn’s reaction once for each card that was healed. So, for example, if you had a hypothetical card that healed 1 horror from each investigator at a location, you could trigger Carolyn’s reaction once for each of those investigators, granting each of them 1 resource. **Q:** So it looks like the key is the number of different cards healed. The owner of any card which gets healed gets (max) 1 resource per card. So to be entirely explicit about the final case"

Is it legit, then, to 'retire' an investigator with story assets, then 'rejoin' with that investigator later, strictly to avoid risking the story asset (such as on The Essex County Express), and not because that player is sitting out the game? And for that matter, can a 4-player campaign load all the story assets onto one player, and have that player sit Essex County for this purpose?\" **Answer**: \"I don’t think there’s anything explicitly preventing players from doing this as far as the rules are concerned, but I think doing so would go against the spirit of the rules. The ability to retire from and/or join an in-progress campaign exists to give players more freedom when playing through a campaign with friends. Schedules can sometimes be hectic, and when it comes to gaming, real life comes first. Sometimes players cannot make it to a play session, and sometimes you'd like to include a friend mid-campaign without having to start over. These rules were written in such a way as to allow players the freedom to have players drop in and out with relative ease, without compromising the integrity of any player’s deck, or the story. I would urge players to not intentionally abuse these rules to try and get around specific story resolution effects.\"",

If I use Knowledge is Power on Old Book of Lore, do I need to spend a secret to use the \"immediately play that card\" part of the ability? Clearly Knowledge is Power does not allow me to ignore any costs of the card I'm about to play (c.f. ruling on [De Vermis Mysteriis](/card/05235)), but does the \"may X to Y\" templating here mean spending a secret here a cost?",

                "answer": "In general, unless otherwise specified, players can “return” such a card from any play area, so long as it is in an area that allows the card to be found and identified. For example, if Cheap Shot is in the discard pile or attached to another card (such as a [Crystallizer of Dreams](/card/06024)) and you are able to find it, you may return it to your hand from that area. However, if it is in a place where its position is impossible to determine (such as shuffled into your deck) or facedown in a place where you are not allowed to look at its other side (for example, as a swarm card), you would be unable to return it to your hand, and therefore that aspect of the effect would fail. Additionally, if Cheap Shot is removed from the game, unless specifically stated otherwise, no game effects can interact with it in any way until the end of the game. -"

                "question": "I was wondering if you could provide an official ruling on how Swarm cards interact with [Mind Wipe](/card/01068). Mind Wipe says to treat the text box of the enemy as if it were blank. Therefore, if an enemy has the text \"hunter\", that would be ignored. For \"swarm\", would this effect discard the swarm cards (on the grounds the host has no text to maintain them) or would it mean the host enemy can now be attacked directly (since it's host cards are no longer considered a swarm textually) or would simply nothing happen because swarms are treated as enemies and thus unaffected? Or perhaps something we have overlooked?",
                "answer": "Generally speaking, the rules for the swarming keyword only apply when the enemy enters play. Once it has entered play with the indicated number of swarm cards, the existence of the swarming keyword no longer really matters; all of the rules pertaining to swarm cards apply regardless (kind of like how the “fast” keyword doesn’t matter once the card in question has been played). So, in other words, no, Mind Wipe will not cause swarm cards to suddenly fall off or stop existing, nor would it allow you to attack the host directly. It may however affect other card effects that only refer to enemies with the swarming keyword (such as an effect like “Add 1 swarm card to each enemy with the swarming keyword”)."

If another card, like [Sharpshooter](/card/60327) or [Delilah O'Rourke](/card/06281), references the evade value of something with a '-', like Swamp Leech or [Vulnerable Heart](/card/85043), is it treated as 0 for those purposes as well?

If you declare you’re going to trigger [Olive McBride's](/card/04197) ability first, you should then declare which of the 3 tokens you’re about to reveal from Olive’s ability will be turned into 2 tokens from the [Grotesque Statue](/card/01071) (For example, “I’m going to reveal 3 tokens using Olive, and for the first token, I’m going to reveal 2 instead of 1 using my statue). Then you’ll ignore one of the 2 statue tokens, and be left with 3 total tokens, which you’ll then ignore 1 of. (All of these tokens are considered to be revealed simultaneously, so you are not allowed to reveal the\nfirst 2 tokens with Olive, and then decide whether or not to use the statue). \nIf you instead trigger the statue’s ability first, you would do the same thing, declaring your intent. (For example, “I’m going to reveal 2 tokens using my statue, but for the second token, I’m going to use Olive’s ability to reveal 3 instead of 1”.) Then you would choose between resolving the first token or the 3 Olive tokens. (Here this may seem a little strange, because Grotesque Statue says “Choose 1 of those tokens to resolve, and ignore the other,” which implies that you only get to resolve 1 token and ignore 1 token, but for the purposes of resolving these types of effects, the 3 tokens revealed from Olive’s ability should be treated as 1 revealed token.) If you decide to resolve the 3 Olive tokens you would then choose 2 to resolve and resolve the other, as usual. - FAQ v.1.3, May 2018",

There is a ruling from 'Smite the Wicked' which says: > Generally, you reshuffle the encounter discard pile into the encounter deck when it is empty, but not while you’re resolving an effect. I see that any effect that interacts with the deck (such as [Parallel Fates](/card/08066)) would wait to shuffle until after the card resolves; but: If I draw my card during the Mythos phase, emptying the deck, do I shuffle immediately; and thus my drawn card is the first card of the new discard pile?

                "question": "Per FAQ 2.0 entry 2.19 [\"Take an action\" vs \"Perform/resolve an action\"](/rules#Take_An_Action_Vs_Perform_An_Action)] we are told to distinguish between effects that instruct a player to perform an action and ones that instruct a player to take an action. The implication appears to be that only the former are intended to \"count\" for effects that count how many actions have been taken so far in a turn. However, the most commonly played card that counts actions taken, [Pay Day](/card/04233), actually counts how many actions have been \"performed\". Is that simply imprecise templating? Similarly [Frozen in Fear](/card/01164) triggers when actions are \"performed\" despite the common understanding that only abilities that cost actions in the first place can be taxed by FiF. Finally, and in the same vein, bold action designators on free triggered abilities or reactions also \"perform\" actions. Am I correct that they are not intended to be taxed by FiF or count towards Pay Day?",

In other words, after playing Let God Sort Them Out with an action in step 2.2.1, does the game sequence continue as normal and return to the previous player window, or does \"immediately end your turn\" skip the sequence ahead to step 2.2.2? If it skips ahead, how would this interact with effects that end your turn at unusual times (e.g. drawing a symbol on [Rite of Seeking](/card/01689) during an action taken in the mythos phase with [Quick Thinking](/card/02229)?) **A",

                "question": "Per FAQ 2.0 entry 2.19 [\"Take an action\" vs \"Perform/resolve an action\"](/rules#Take_An_Action_Vs_Perform_An_Action)] we are told to distinguish between effects that instruct a player to perform an action and ones that instruct a player to take an action. The implication appears to be that only the former are intended to \"count\" for effects that count how many actions have been taken so far in a turn. However, the most commonly played card that counts actions taken, [Pay Day](/card/04233), actually counts how many actions have been \"performed\". Is that simply imprecise templating? Similarly [Frozen in Fear](/card/01164) triggers when actions are \"performed\" despite the common understanding that only abilities that cost actions in the first place can be taxed by FiF. Finally, and in the same vein, bold action designators on free triggered abilities or reactions also \"perform\" actions. Am I correct that they are not intended to be taxed by FiF or count towards Pay Day?",

Additionally the FAQ entry [Resolving Multiple Revealed Chaos Tokens](/rules#Resolving_Multiple_Revealed_Chaos_Tokens): \"[...] when resolving multiple chaos tokens, any game or card effects which trigger if a certain chaos token is revealed—such as the text “If the named chaos token is revealed during this skill test…” on [Recall the Future](/card/04158)—will trigger if any of the resolved chaos tokens meet the specified conditions.

In this case the condition is “after a (symbol) token is revealed during a skill test.” Therefore, if two symbols are revealed during a skill test, the reaction may be triggered twice. (This would be different if it read “1 or more tokens.”) As for the second ruling [the FAQ], that doesn’t apply here. That ruling is specifically talking about effects within another ability that trigger if a chaos token is revealed, such as the horror-dealing effect on [Shrivelling](/card/01060).

Is it legit, then, to 'retire' an investigator with story assets, then 'rejoin' with that investigator later, strictly to avoid risking the story asset (such as on The Essex County Express), and not because that player is sitting out the game? And for that matter, can a 4-player campaign load all the story assets onto one player, and have that player sit Essex County for this purpose?\" **Answer**: \"I don’t think there’s anything explicitly preventing players from doing this as far as the rules are concerned, but I think doing so would go against the spirit of the rules. The ability to retire from and/or join an in-progress campaign exists to give players more freedom when playing through a campaign with friends. Schedules can sometimes be hectic, and when it comes to gaming, real life comes first. Sometimes players cannot make it to a play session, and sometimes you'd like to include a friend mid-campaign without having to start over. These rules were written in such a way as to allow players the freedom to have players drop in and out with relative ease, without compromising the integrity of any player’s deck, or the story. I would urge players to not intentionally abuse these rules to try and get around specific story resolution effects.\"",

                "answer": "So normally, if you fail a skill test while attacking an enemy engaged with another investigator, you’d deal damage to that investigator. Shotgun has a replacement effect for this situation, specifying that the failed attack deals 1 damage for each point failed by to that investigator. If you played Oops! (2) in that situation, you would deal damage to the chosen enemy equal to the amount you failed the test by (up to 3, according to the text on Oops! (2)), and no damage to the other investigator. (Note, if you were attacking an enemy with Shotgun that wasn’t engaged with another investigator and then failed, you wouldn’t deal any damage with Oops! (2).)"

You are able to do this because Emergency Aid did have the potential to change the game state before the attack of opportunity occurred (because Morgan was damaged). If, hypothetically speaking, no characters in play were damaged at the time you began playing Emergency Aid, then it would have no potential to change the game state and it would immediately abort the process before the card is even played. The same is true if you, for example, used [A Chance Encounter](/card/02270) to bring an ally back from your discard pile, and triggered an attack of opportunity that ended up defeating a different ally; you could then use A Chance Encounter to bring that ally back instead of the original one.",

Specifically are there any skill effects not cancelled by these effects? My primary confusion results from cards like [On the Mend](/card/09006). If On The Mend's **Forced** effect is also cancelled is it discarded instead of being returned to Vincent's set aside area? If so and Vincent shuffles his discard into his deck how should the Limit 1 in hand be resolved if he attempts to draw a copy of On the Mend when one is already there? Similarly for things like [Unrelenting](/card/07196), is the text that returns the sealed tokens at test end canceled? Does it matter because the default rules for seal would resolve at that time?",
                "answer": "We reviewed the scenario cards in question and we will plan to address them in the next FAQ, either with errata or with additional clarification. We believe that, when a scenario card such as Where Doom Awaits states to “cancel the effects and icons” of committed skill cards, this only applies to non-weakness skill cards and only lasts until Step 7 of that skill test. This should clarify our intentions for such a scenario. This should allow for On the Mend to be returned to hand as intended instead of discarded, and for Weakness skill cards such as [Dreams of the Deep](/card/98015) to function as intended. As for Unrelenting, there is already a rule in place that if a card with sealed tokens leaves play, those tokens are immediately released, so the tokens would still be returned even if the card’s effects were canceled during the test."

But examining the text of the card line by line, we see that it only really does 2 things: 1) Instead of the test’s difficulty being equal to the shroud value of your location, the test’s difficulty is equal to the highest shroud value among revealed locations in play. 2) If you succeed, you discover 1 clue from each revealed location in play (and this is not a replacement effect). You’re still technically investigating your location. For example, if you played Deciphered Reality while in the [Orne Library](/card/02050), you would still need to spend an additional action to investigate. Likewise, you couldn’t play Deciphered Reality at a location with a [Locked Door](/card/01174).",

Generally, investigators have 3 actions to take whenever they take a turn, and each investigator takes one turn during the investigation phase. If a card effect grants you a new turn, either explicitly or in this case by allowing you to repeat the investigation phase, the investigators should be granted a full turn’s worth of actions once again.

This is very punishing, but there doesn't seem to be any way for Yithian Norman to avoid it by a strict reading of the rules. **A:** According to rules as written, yes—Yithian Norman Withers must place The Harbinger facedown on top of his deck when he draws it, each time he draws it.

                "question": "I have a question about some card interactions for cards that trigger 'at the end of your turn' and 'during your turn'. To draw a specific example, if [Monterey Jack](/card/08007)'s [reaction] ability draws [Cryptic Writings](/card/60215), is he allowed to trigger Cryptic Writing's ability and play it? More generally, when an ability triggers 'at the end of my turn', is that 'during my turn'? And similarly, if an ability triggers 'at the start of my turn' is that 'during my turn'?",
                "answer": "Short answer, yes, “at the end of your turn” is still “during your turn”, so you would be able to play Cryptic Writings if you drew it with Monterey Jack’s triggered ability. (By extension, “at the start of your turn” should also count as being “during your turn.”)"

If another card, like [Sharpshooter](/card/60327) or [Delilah O'Rourke](/card/06281), references the evade value of something with a '-', like Swamp Leech or [Vulnerable Heart](/card/85043), is it treated as 0 for those purposes as well? Or is the ability just unable to fire? What about investigating the [Hidden Tunnel](/card/08630) in [City of the Elder Things](/card/08621) (for something like [Searching for Izzie](/card/02011), [Call of the Unknown](/card/04009), or [Buried Secrets](/card/08009))?",
                "answer": "After re-examining these cards and the direction our game has taken, we are going to override the previous ruling. Even if Swamp Leech were blanked with Mind Wipe, its Evade value would still be a “-“, which can be thought of as “null” or a “non-number.” You could not use this non-number as the basis for a skill test with Sharpshooter. It’s, as you said, unable to fire. This also means that you could not investigate at Hidden Tunnel."

If so, does it ignore the additional action cost of that ability?",
                "answer": "This ability allows you to “take up to 3 different fight or evade actions.” This effectively grants you (up to) 3 additional actions, which each must be spent to trigger a different fight or evade ability (see [\"Different\"](/rules#Different) and [\"Take an action\" vs \"perform an action\"](/rules#take_an_action_vs_perform_an_action)). One of the 3 fight or evade actions taken by Discipline (Balance of Body) can be a multiaction ability, but if so, you must still pay the additional action cost of that ability, and those additional actions would have to come from your standard pool of actions or from a source other than Discipline (Balance of Body). You cannot use Discipline (Balance of Body) to use Sledgehammer’s triple-action on its own, nor can you use it to dodge the additional action cost of that ability. -"

Can I put the cards into play after they are committed?",
                "answer": "In FAQ 2.0 there is going to be a name for the state you’re describing, where a committed card is while being committed, called [limbo](/rules#Limbo). These cards are not in play, not out of play, not in hand, and not in a discard pile, but they are still affecting the game in some way. That said, Unearth the Ancients doesn’t put the chosen cards into limbo; they will stay in hand after being chosen. Rules as written says that yes, you could commit the chosen cards to the test, and put them into play when the test resolves. We may revisit this in a future FAQ (not 2.0, which is about to be released)."

                "question": "How is [Down the Rabbit Hole](/card/08059) supposed to interact with Exile cards, Deck Size changes, or other effects where a deck isn't full during between-scenario-purchasing? Based on the rule: If 1 or more cards are forcibly removed from an investigator’s deck and returned to the collection (such as when a card is exiled, or when a campaign effect forces an investigator to remove cards from their deck), that investigator must purchase cards so that a legal deck size is maintained. When purchasing cards in this manner, that investigator may purchase level 0 cards at 0 experience cost until a legal deck size is reached. I can see interpretations where the cost is 0 (+1 for Down the Rabbit Hole) per empty-card-replacement, or where \"at 0 experience\" reads as \"without paying an experience cost\". If the intent is for empty card-slot replacements to cost 1xp, what happens if the player doesn't have enough XP to refill their deck? Again, I see two possibilities: Pay all of your XP, effectively paying as much as you can; or If a deck cannot afford to buy itself back to full, the character becomes unplayable, so start a new deck.",
                "answer": "Fair question; no, Down the Rabbit Hole would not require an investigator to spend additional XP when needing to purchase level 0 cards to maintain a legal deck size. Those level 0 cards would cost 0 XP until the investigator has reached a legal deck size again."

When using Foresight, do I have to name a card before I start searching or can I start searching and say name of the card right before drawing ( so I would know for 100% what card I will draw). I don't know if effect \"search and draw\" can be interrupted by playing card like Foresight.",
                "answer": "Though you could play Foresight during “search and draw” abilities, we are ruling that you can only “name a card” before looking at the cards from the search. In a future FAQ (not 2.0, which was just released) we will expand on the different ways to resolve Foresight."

What about a spell like [Enchanted Bow](/card/08118)? Do I use it the same way by revealing and playing by exhausting True Magick (meaning I could only use the Bow once per turn) and paying the charge if I'm trying to use the ranged ability? Does the fact that it also would take up hand slots if played traditionally complicate this? Essentially, is the spell I play from my hand momentarily overlaying True Magick and the spots it occupies? If so, anything that takes only an arcane slot or an arcane + hand slot would be fine, but the bow would need a second free hand slot in order to work and would kick anything out that was being held.",

If I use the [intellect] or [combat] skill type of test, and [Deduction](/card/01039) or [Vicious Blow](/card/01025) has been committed to the corresponding skill type of test, and the card does not have a charge, how do I resolve the effect of the skill card?

                "answer": "Yes, as long as spending a charge isn’t part of the cost to activate the indicated action (and it isn’t, for those cards.) You can fight with Brand of Cthugha and end up spending 0 charges to deal 0 damage (but increase the amount with Vicious Blow, for example). Similarly, activating Divination, spending 0 charges, then using Deduction can still allow you to discover 1 clue at your location.

[Pocket Telescope](/card/08097) does not specify anything about engagement, but FAQ 2.10 says that \"The game state is considered to be altered throughout the duration of the indicated ability or action, from its initiation (including the paying of its costs, attacks of opportunity, etc)...\" and \"Other card abilities or game effects resolved during this duration are also resolved with the altered game state in mind.\" This seems to indicate that if you use Pocket Telescope to investigate as if at a location with a ready, unengaged enemy, that enemy will engage you (although it will not physically move to your threat area), and it will make an attack of opportunity against you. Is that correct?",
                "answer": "Attacks of Opportunity occur immediately after the cost of initiating the action, but before the application of the action’s effect. In other words, when you attempt to use Pocket Telescope’s “Investigate” action, the “cost” to initiate it is spending one of your player actions, and this is the moment when Attacks of Opportunity occur. Enemies **at your current location** [*emphasis in original email*] would perform Attacks of Opportunity against you, and enemies at the connecting location you’re investigating would not, because the trigger for these Attacks has passed."

                "answer": "This one was tricker to determine [cf two rulings on [Easy Mark](/card/06026)], because of how “then” and “After” in abilities interact. What we determined is, Scroll of Prophecies’ final sentence would be treated as a single triggering condition, given priority because it has a “then” clause in its ability whereas Cryptic Writings has an “After” in its ability. To put it simply, Scroll of Prophecies needs to resolve in full before Cryptic Writings resolves. If Cryptic Writings was discarded as a consequence of resolving Scroll of Prophecies, Cryptic Writings could not trigger from the discard pile, as it cannot be “played” from this out-of-play area. Hopefully that makes sense! **Further discussion**: There's one thing I don't understand about your explanation, and I was wondering if you could indulge me with a clarification. You mentioned that Cryptic Writings can't be \"played\" from the discard pile. Is that because of \"Card abilities only interact with other cards that are in play, unless the ability specifically references an interaction with cards in an out-of-play area.\" under [Ability](/rules#Ability) in the RR? If so, why can Cryptic Writings be \"played\" from hand (also an out-of-play area)? To be clear, obviously it *must* be playable from hand, otherwise the ability doesn't function... but how does that fit into the rules framework? I noticed that most of the other cards that work like this (particularly [Easy Mark](/card/06026), but also e.g. Archaic Glyphs, Dexter Drake, Ever Vigilant, Farsight) specify \"from your hand\""

                "question": "Does [Lonnie Ritter](/card/60309) require a damaged asset for her ability to work? Or is this a case of \"doing as much as you can\", so as long as you can heal Lonnie, you can still target a non-damaged item instead?",
                "answer": "Lonnie Ritter’s ability states: “ Exhaust Lonnie Ritter and spend 1 resource: Choose an Item asset controlled by an investigator at your location. Heal 1 damage from that asset and 1 horror from Lonnie Ritter.” It is true that the only costs of the ability are exhausting Lonnie and spending 1 resource, and the choosing and healing of an item are effects, not costs. However, whenever you see the word “choose” in an ability, there are a few additional rules to keep in mind. These rules can be found under the [Target](/rules#Target) section of the Rules Reference.\n\n The term \"choose\" indicates that one or more targets must be chosen in order for an ability to resolve. The player resolving the ability must choose a game element (usually a card) that meets the targeting requirements of the ability. If an ability requires the choosing of a target, and there is no valid target (or not enough valid targets), the ability cannot be initiated.\nIn other words, you cannot use Lonnie’s ability if there is no Item to target with its effect. The question remains—can you choose an item with no damage on it (or even, an item with no health value at all?) simply to heal 1 horror from Lonnie. Thankfully, the Rules Reference answers this question as well, in that same section:\nA card is not an eligible target for an ability if the resolution of that ability's effect could not change the target's state. (For example, an exhausted enemy could not be chosen as the target of an effect that reads, \"choose and exhaust an enemy.\")\nSo there you have it—you must choose an eligible target in order to activate Lonnie’s ability, and an item that cannot be healed is not an eligible target. This is true even though healing 1 damage from the chosen item is an effect and not a cost, because the word “choose” indicates that one or more eligible targets must be chosen in order for the ability to correctly resolve, and a target can only be chosen if the ability’s effect has the potential to change its game state."

Third and finally, taking the wording of [Read the Signs](/card/06117) into account are we now to understand Haunted to be a keyword that *triggers* in St.6 but in fact sets up a delayed effect that resolves at a later timing point? Otherwise I'm unsure how Read the Signs is supposed to ignore Haunted (which is it's traditionally understood use case.) **A:** 1) Neither Rain nor Snow can cancel Alert/Retaliate (and Haunted), treating all as “effects of the failed skill test.” 2) If playing Live and Learn, Alert/Retaliate would have resolved already during Step 7 of the initial test, as “effects of the failed test.” 3) Yes, Read the Signs was always intended to be able to ignore Haunted, a “keyword on your location that would trigger during this investigation.” 4) There is also no mechanical difference between “effects of the failed test” and “effects from the failed test.”",

Could I use two such abilities to perform two actions, thus granting me Quick Learner's difficulty reduction for the rest of my turn?

The first time you try to leave the location you will trigger the ability and be forced to test agility, taking 1 damage if you fail. After that, regardless of whether you succeeded or failed, the Forced ability cannot be triggered again (by you) for the remainder of the round, so you are free to move again without having to perform the test. That said, there are two things to note about this ability: 1) The Shores of Hali states that each location with a horror token gains that Forced ability. That means that the limit once per round applies once to each of those locations, not once to all of the locations as a whole. (Basically, imagine that each of those locations actually has the ability written on it.) So, if you attempt to move from one location with horror on it, you’ll trigger the ability and be forced to test agility. Then once moved to another location with horror on it and attempting to move again, you’ll trigger the ability on the new location and be forced to make the test again. 2) Limit once per round is player-specific, so another investigator will trigger the ability even if you have already triggered it this round."

Nonetheless, even though you can't place doom on the \"nearest\" cultist, they are still in play, so does Mysterious Chanting oblige you to search for a cultist? **A**: Not exactly. Even if it has no valid path to an investigator, an enemy can still qualify as the \"nearest\" enemy if there are no other enemies in play that are nearer. It might help to think of it this way: an enemy at a location with no valid path to your location is – in essence – an infinite number of locations away. If there were any other enemy anywhere, even if it were 100 locations away, that would be nearer. But if there were no other enemies in play, then that enemy an infinite number of locations away would still be the nearest. That said, effects that require an enemy to track a path to an investigator (such as [Dance of the Yellow King](/card/03097), for example) would fail in this circumstance, because the enemy cannot possibly track a path to you, even if they are the \"nearest\" enemy.",

If you try to return them to your hand, they will instead go to their owner’s equivalent out-of-play area (see [Ownership & Control](/rules#Ownership_and_Control): \"If a card would enter an out-of-play area that does not belong to the card’s owner, the card is physically placed in its owner’s equivalent out-of-play area instead. The card is considered to have entered its controller’s out-of-play area, and only the physical placement of the card is adjusted.\") However, in this case, the owner is the scenario itself, and the scenario has no hand. So it would instead simply be discarded (this would of course trigger the **Forced** effect on [Innocent Revelers](/card/82021), so probably not the best move).

                "text": "After a non-Elite enemy enters attached location: Exhaust that enemy, disengage it from all investigators, and attach Snare Trap to it.” This is a forced ability that triggers after the enemy enters the attached location. However, any time a ready unengaged enemy is at the same location as an investigator, it engages that investigator (\"[Enemy Engagement](/rules#Enemy_Engagement),\" RR page 10). This is a constant effect that the game is always checking and therefore has timing priority over Forced abilities. As a result, the enemy would enter your location and immediately engage you before you could trigger any “after” effects in response to the enemy entering your location. Then, since engaging you is a triggering condition for another ability, this begins a nested sequence. You must execute any abilities that respond to the enemy engaging you before you can return to the original triggering condition (the enemy entering your location). So then you would execute the Maniac’s **Forced** effect (as well as any other **Forced** effects in response to Maniac engaging you). Finally, you would return to the original triggering condition and respond to the enemy entering your location, triggering the Forced ability on Snare Trap. So, to sum up:\n\n 1) Maniac enters your location.\n\n 2) Maniac immediately engages you. This is a constant ability, so it has timing priority over “after” effects that respond to the enemy entering your location.\n\n 3) Execute abilities that respond to enemy engagement (such as Maniac’s ability) \n\n 4) Return to original triggering condition and execute abilities that respond to the Maniac entering your location (such as Snare Trap’s ability).\n\n That’s a nested sequence for you! It would be even more complicated if you had abilities that responded to taking damage! (Those abilities would trigger in between steps 3 and 4, for the record.)",

                "text": "If there are no Lunatic enemies in play, Dance of the Yellow King gains surge. Otherwise, test [willpower] (3). If you fail, the nearest Lunatic enemy readies, moves (one location at a time) until it reaches your location, engages you, and makes an immediate attack.” \n\n This effect forces an enemy to do 4 effects (ready, move, engage, and attack). Generally speaking, effects that are listed with the word “and” are not dependent on one another (for example, if an effect said “draw 1 card and gain 1 resource” I could still gain 1 resource even if I could not draw cards). However, in this case, some of these effects are dependent on one another simply by virtue of what they are. For example, if an enemy that is not at your location cannot move, it also cannot engage you, because engaging you would cause it to move to your location. Likewise, if an enemy was not engaged with an investigator, “make an attack” would not do anything, because the game has no way of knowing who the enemy attacks. (Note that this would be different had the card read “makes an immediate attack against you.”) That being said, neither movement nor attacks are dependent on the enemy being ready – enemies don’t normally move from the hunter keyword while exhausted or attack during the enemy phase while exhausted, but exhausted enemies can still move or attack from on card effects.\n \n So, here’s what would happen in this circumstance: If a Lunatic has Snare Trap attached when you draw Dance of the Yellow King, it would not ready because it would instead discard the Snare Trap, but it would still move towards you, engage and attack, because these effects are not dependent on the enemy remaining ready. If a Lunatic is moving toward you from Dance of the Yellow King and enters a location with a Snare Trap, it would immediately exhaust, disengage, and have Snare Trap attached to it… But then it would continue moving towards you, engage you, and attack.\n\n Man, Lunatics are pretty relentless when being manipulated by Him Who Is Not To Be Named, aren’t they?",

                "answer": "Multiple investigators could technically purchase the card, but only one copy could actually be put into play when the game begins. Since each of them would be put into play at the same time, the investigators would decide which one is put into play first (with the lead investigator breaking any conflicts). The other copies of Charon’s Obol would not be put into play, nor would they be shuffled into their owner’s deck (as per the rules for the Permanent keyword). Only the investigator with Charon’s Obol in play would receive its benefits (or its consequences, for that matter)."

                "answer": "Not unless an effect explicitly allows you to do so. Generally cards are only removed from your deck if you purchase a new card and must swap out an existing card in order to reach your investigator’s deck size. However, since Permanent cards do not count towards your deck size, they cannot be swapped out in this way. There is no rule which allows you to remove cards from your deck at will. -"

More generally, how does this card interact with scrying? What happens if the action I've performed, like [Calling in Favors](/card/03158), has shuffled my deck?",
                "answer": "To the extent that cards can be returned in the same order, they should be. So for example, if you use Scrying to reorder the top 3 cards of the encounter deck and then play Time Warp, you should go back and reorder those cards into their original order. Likewise, if I drew a card and then played Time Warp, the card I drew should be returned to the top of my deck. If you are unable to return the game state to exactly the way it was before the action was performed, the effect fails.To the extent that you know the exact order of things, you should return the game state to exactly the way it was. But for cards whose order you did not know, it’s fine to keep them randomized. For example, if I played No Stone Unturned and searched my deck for any card (let’s say Encyclopedia), it was part of my unknown randomized deck, so if somebody then plays Time Warp, I can (and should) just shuffle Encyclopedia back into my deck and that satisfies the effect of Time Warp. But, as previously noted, if I drew a card from the top of my deck and then played Time Warp, the card I drew should be returned to the top of my deck, because I knew that’s where it was.\n\nHowever, *a randomized deck is a randomized deck* – there’s no way of knowing the exact order of the cards, so keeping it shuffled is fine. You still don’t know what the order of the deck was, so the game state is effectively the same. [this is another super useful point]"

If so, what happens if you play [Deny Existence](/card/05032)? Can you ignore the direct damage being dealt to your allies? Can you ignore all of the damage being dealt, or do you have to pick just one of the one-damage hits to ignore? If you use Deny 5 to ignore the direct damage being dealt to an ally, the healing still applies to your investigator card, right?",
                "answer": "We rule that if you were to play Deny Existence (5), you could ignore one of the following effects on Centuries of Secrets: dealing 1 damage to yourself, or dealing 1 damage to one of your Ally assets (not each, unfortunately). Depending on which you ignored, you could either heal 1 from your investigator, or 1 from the chosen Ally."

If another card, like [Sharpshooter](/card/60327) or [Delilah O'Rourke](/card/06281), references the evade value of something with a '-', like Swamp Leech or [Vulnerable Heart](/card/85043), is it treated as 0 for those purposes as well? Or is the ability just unable to fire?

Even if Swamp Leech were blanked with Mind Wipe, its Evade value would still be a “-“, which can be thought of as “null” or a “non-number.” You could not use this non-number as the basis for a skill test with Sharpshooter. It’s, as you said, unable to fire. This also means that you could not investigate at Hidden Tunnel."

The card is considered to have entered its controller’s out-of-play area, and only the physical placement of the card is adjusted.\") However, in this case, the owner is the scenario itself, and the scenario has no hand. So it would instead simply be discarded (this would of course trigger the **Forced** effect on [Innocent Revelers](/card/82021), so probably not the best move).

Previously, if I had an ally in play and wanted to play an ally, I would first have to discard that ally because I was “at my slot limit” for allies. With the new rule, I only have to discard the ally that is in play if playing a new ally would put me above my slot limit.

                "answer": "Deny Existence only allows you to ignore a single effect, such as one instance of horror, or one instance of discarding cards. Whether an effect is a “single cumulative effect” or “separate effects” depends on whether the effect forces the investigator to make a choice. For example, [Terrible Secret](/card/05015) must be resolved as “separate effects”, because the investigator is choosing whether to discard or take 1 horror for each card beneath Diana Stanley. Deny Existence can only ignore discarding one card or taking one horror; it cannot ignore all horror or all cards that would be discarded, as these are separate effects. -"

The real question is: when does the committed card enter or leave play? Generally speaking, cards placed beneath other cards (such as the card beneath Amanda Sharpe) are out of play. Cards committed to tests never\nreally \"enter play,\" but while they are committed to a test, their icons are added to the investigator’s relevant skill and their text is active. So, while the card beneath Amanda is committed to a test, its icons and text should be alterable by game effects (as if you had committed it from your hand), just like any other in-play card. But as soon as that test ends, it returns to its out-of-play state, and any lasting effects would drop. TL;DR: The bonus icon granted by Grisly Totem would only apply for the\ntest during which Grisly Totem is used, after which the card returns to its out-of-play state, and the bonus icon would drop. -"

Each effect on either location that would trigger during that investigation still triggers, so long as you haven’t passed its initiation point. For example, if you choose [Experimental Therapies Ward](/card/06072), you may resolve its triggered ability of taking 1 horror to give it –2 shroud for the investigation. By that same logic, the **Forced** effect on [Grand Chamber](/card/04064) will trigger if you do not succeed the skill test by at least 2. -",

A: The intent is that De Vermis Mysteriis would not remove an event that turns into an attachment from the game until such time that it would normally become detached (for example, when Barricade would be discarded, it would instead be removed from the game). This is reinforced a little bit by the rules for events, which read: “any time a player plays an event card, its costs are paid, its effects are resolved (or canceled), and the card is placed in its owner's discard pile after those effects resolve (or are canceled).” In other words, events that become attachments already circumvent the traditional rules for what happens when you play an event, and I think the same would be true here.

                "question": "A previous ruling on the location [Historical Society](/card/03130) [see that card for the ruling] stated: \"A '+1 skill value' is an all-encompassing term suggestion that you're getting +1 to the relevant skill that the test is checking.\" [This ruling is not on ArkhamDB, I'm tracking it down.] With the direct implication that, for that location, [Lockpicks](/card/01687), [intellect] commits, positive chaos tokens, and other modifiers cannot increase your [intellect] during investigations. That is, there is no concept of the term \"skill value\" referring to a separate quantity from an investigator's printed skill + relevant modifiers; when a skill is modified during a skill test from any source, that skill is literally being increased or decreased. How should this ruling be applied to Circle tests from the scenario [Union and Disillusion](/card/05238)? Circle tests are \"considered to be a test of both skill types\", so the straightforward implication is that in, for instance, a [combat] + [intellect] Circle test, a drawn chaos token modifiers both the investigator's combat and their intellect before the skill values are summed to determine the final skill value. For example, if [Joe Diamond](/card/05002) with no cards in play initiated a [combat] + [intellect] Circle test, his initial skill value would be 4 + 4 = 8, and then if he drew a -2 token, his final skill value would be (4-2) + (4-2) = 4. Is this the correct interpretation, or should chaos tokens apply \"normally\" (i.e. only once) for Circle tests? If they apply \"normally\", should this be considered an exception for Circle tests in particular, or is there something wrong with my understanding of skill values being directly modified by chaos tokens and other effects during skill tests?",

For example, if you used the grenades on an enemy and committed Vicious Blow to the skill test, the attacked enemy would take the additional +1 damage from Vicious Blow, but Vicious Blow would not affect the damage dealt to all of the other enemies at the location. As for Marksmanship, yes, you can absolutely use it with the Grenades! As with the above example, the bonus +1 damage from Marksmanship would be dealt to the attacked enemy, and not to the other enemies at the location."

Ending your turn doesn’t mean that you can’t trigger effects, it just means that you can no longer take actions. Since the second playing of the card doesn’t cost an action in this case, you can go ahead and resolve it even though your turn has ended. HOWEVER, due to the specific text on Pay Day, doing so would essentially do nothing. It says that you gain 1 resource for each action you performed this turn.

How am I to correctly understand \"This trigger occurs after the card has resolved in full.\"? According to your reply, I guess that a card is placed in play (e.g. attach to, in play area, in threat area), or in its owner's discard pile. Does this mean \"this card has resolved in full\"? What if a ***Spell*** Asset card is played, or an event card (e.g. [Delay the Inevitable](/card/05021)), in which case, at what point has \"the card resolved in full\"?",

If the ***Spell*** card has a single effect like [Ward of Protection](/card/01065) and then gets discarded, you can trigger Heirloom once it’s in the discard pile. If you instead play a ***Spell*** like [Scrying](/card/01061), you could activate Heirloom once Scrying enters play.

In summary, you would be able to play each of the cards you mentioned, so long as their conditions are met. Let’s say you are playing Luke Robinson and are currently in Dream-Gate. Per its ability text, Dream-Gate is connected to each other revealed location. Luke Robinson’s ability allows you to play one event each turn as if you were at a connecting location and engaged with each enemy at that location. “As if” is a phrasing that alters the game state in the manner described for the duration described—in other words, you can play an event card during your turn and essentially act as if you are in that location until the event card is fully resolved. You decide your event for the turn is Read the Signs, and thanks to being in Dream-Gate, you are able to investigate at any revealed location, and act as if you are in that location. There is a window of opportunity before the card fully resolves where you can play a “Fast” event card and create what’s known as a “nested sequence.” All of that to say, Practice Makes Perfect would be valid in the location you are investigating; you can resolve it while the “as if” condition is altering the game state. You could also play Crack the Case if the last remaining clue was discovered at that location during the investigation action of Read the Signs."

Once Luke discovers 2 clues at the location and Drawn to the Flame ends, the enemy cannot stay engaged with Luke while he’s in Dream-Gate, so the enemy would remain behind at the location Luke discovered clues at."

However, while it is set aside and out of play it functions more like a player card, for deckbuilding purposes and the like. So if Gate Box moves you, that is a player card effect moving you, but when Dream-Gate moves you, that would be an encounter card effect moving you.\" MJ says: \"While Dream-Gate is in play, it is an encounter card\", does this mean that when the effect of an encounter card conflicts with the Constant Abilities of Dream-Gate, The Silver Rule will itwork? For example, during Luke's turn, Luke is in Dream-Gate (Wondrous Journey) and draws a [Dance of the Yellow King](/card/03097). The skill test fails, the nearest Lunatic will move towards Luke. If both cards are encounter cards, may I decide which takes precedence? If so, does the enemy stay in the same place?",
                "answer": "If Luke is in Dream-Gate, enemies cannot enter it, nor can enemies move closer to him, so Dance of the Yellow King would not move the enemy anywhere if Luke failed the [willpower] test.

FAQ entry 1.21 provides some guidance for this situation, instructing us \"If an effect (such as a “cannot move” effect) would cause an investigator or enemy to not be at a location, ignore that effect.\" For example, this allows a Luke with Entombed in his threat area to temporarily ignore Entombed for the purposes of leaving Dream-Gate due to the Forced trigger. However, how should this be applied to Essex County Express? Do we ignore the part of Dream-Gate that says we can only move to revealed locations? If so, since all locations are equally unrevealed, does that mean we can move to any of them, including the Engine Car at the rightmost end? Even though that seems allowed by the rules, I'm concerned it's an abuse of a loophole and against the scenario's spirit. **A:** In the Essex County Express scenario, if somehow Luke is stuck in Dream-Gate when the only revealed location is removed from the game, then Luke should be defeated. We believe this keeps in the spirit of the scenario, and also makes it so the restrictions on the locations are properly followed.",

For example, what happens if Luke is [Entombed](/card/04089) (or the location has [No Turning Back](/card/04228) attached) and he draws [Detached from Reality](/card/06014)? Does this mean, because of The Silver Rule, Luke cannot move into [Dream-Gate](/card/06015b)?",
                "answer": "Because Entombed states that the person it’s attached to cannot disengage or move, this effect is absolute and must be followed. If Luke were Entombed and drew Detached from Reality, Luke would not disengage from enemies or move, he would only either flip Dream-Gate or put Dream-Gate into play."

                "question": "There's a ruling that states: \"I would say that while Dream-Gate is in play, it is an encounter card, since it is a location and location cards are generally encounter cards. However, while it is set aside and out of play it functions more like a player card, for deckbuilding purposes and the like. So if Gate Box moves you, that is a player card effect moving you, but when Dream-Gate moves you, that would be an encounter card effect moving you.\" MJ says: \"While Dream-Gate is in play, it is an encounter card\", does this mean that when the effect of an encounter card conflicts with the Constant Abilities of Dream-Gate, The Silver Rule will itwork? For example, during Luke's turn, Luke is in Dream-Gate (Wondrous Journey) and draws a [Dance of the Yellow King](/card/03097). The skill test fails, the nearest Lunatic will move towards Luke. If both cards are encounter cards, may I decide which takes precedence? If so, does the enemy stay in the same place?",
                "answer": "If Luke is in Dream-Gate, enemies cannot enter it, nor can enemies move closer to him, so Dance of the Yellow King would not move the enemy anywhere if Luke failed the [willpower] test. The Silver Rule comes into play if two cards directly contradict one another in a way that is “impossible to reconcile”, but this is not an instance where the interaction is impossible to reconcile."

                "answer": "To answer your other questions literally, there is nothing on Dream-Gate that would prevent you from playing Read the Signs and then Practice Makes Perfect to investigate there, at Dream-Gate. (It wouldn’t make sense to play Crack the Case”after this interaction, though.) Now, if you were asking about using Luke Robinson’s ability to investigate any revealed location while in Dream-Gate, that’s a little different. In summary, you would be able to play each of the cards you mentioned, so long as their conditions are met. Let’s say you are playing Luke Robinson and are currently in Dream-Gate. Per its ability text, Dream-Gate is connected to each other revealed location. Luke Robinson’s ability allows you to play one event each turn as if you were at a connecting location and engaged with each enemy at that location. “As if” is a phrasing that alters the game state in the manner described for the duration described—in other words, you can play an event card during your turn and essentially act as if you are in that location until the event card is fully resolved. You decide your event for the turn is Read the Signs, and thanks to being in Dream-Gate, you are able to investigate at any revealed location, and act as if you are in that location. There is a window of opportunity before the card fully resolves where you can play a “Fast” event card and create what’s known as a “nested sequence.” All of that to say, Practice Makes Perfect would be valid in the location you are investigating; you can resolve it while the “as if” condition is altering the game state. You could also play Crack the Case if the last remaining clue was discovered at that location during the investigation action of Read the Signs."

Attempt to evade with a base [agility] value of 5.

However, the skill test still takes place. Cards may still be committed to the test, and the investigator’s total modified skill value is still determined, as it may have some bearing on other card abilities. However, if Patrice instead uses the ability on [Stray Cat](/card/01076), which reads: “[free] Discard Stray Cat: Automatically evade a non-***Elite*** enemy at your location,” no skill test is made whatsoever. -",

(Cards that put it directly into play bypassing its cost would be able to put it into play, however.) Cards with a cost of “–” that are played as a copy of a different card, such as [Eidetic Memory](/card/03306), use the resource cost of the copied card, and therefore bypass this restriction. -"

However, if it is in a place where its position is impossible to determine (such as shuffled into your deck) or facedown in a place where you are not allowed to look at its other side (for example, as a swarm card), you would be unable to return it to your hand, and therefore that aspect of the effect would fail. Additionally, if Cheap Shot is removed from the game, unless specifically stated otherwise, no game effects can interact with it in any way until the end of the game. -"

                "answer": "This one was tricker to determine [cf two rulings on [Easy Mark](/card/06026)], because of how “then” and “After” in abilities interact. What we determined is, Scroll of Prophecies’ final sentence would be treated as a single triggering condition, given priority because it has a “then” clause in its ability whereas Cryptic Writings has an “After” in its ability. To put it simply, Scroll of Prophecies needs to resolve in full before Cryptic Writings resolves. If Cryptic Writings was discarded as a consequence of resolving Scroll of Prophecies, Cryptic Writings could not trigger from the discard pile, as it cannot be “played” from this out-of-play area. Hopefully that makes sense! **Further discussion**: There's one thing I don't understand about your explanation, and I was wondering if you could indulge me with a clarification. You mentioned that Cryptic Writings can't be \"played\" from the discard pile. Is that because of \"Card abilities only interact with other cards that are in play, unless the ability specifically references an interaction with cards in an out-of-play area.\" under [Ability](/rules#Ability) in the RR? If so, why can Cryptic Writings be \"played\" from hand (also an out-of-play area)? To be clear, obviously it *must* be playable from hand, otherwise the ability doesn't function... but how does that fit into the rules framework? I noticed that most of the other cards that work like this (particularly [Easy Mark](/card/06026), but also e.g. Archaic Glyphs, Dexter Drake, Ever Vigilant, Farsight) specify \"from your hand\""

My understanding is that locked door has a permanent ability, not triggered. But we were curious about the fact that locked door prevent any investigating, could read the signs be played if it would allow instead to ignore permanent abilities as well?",
                "answer": "You are correct, but there are two reasons why Read the Signs does not interact with Locked Door. The first is that the text on Locked Door that prevents you from investigating is not a triggered ability, it is a constant ability. Read the Signs says “you may ignore any effect or keyword on your location which would trigger during this investigation.” Therefore only triggered abilities (keywords and Forced abilities, for the most part) are ignored. But secondly, Read the Signs only allows you to ignore effects or keywords on the location itself, not on cards attached to the location. Locked Door does not grant any text to its location, it simply reads “The attached location cannot be investigated.” Even if this were a forced ability, Read the Signs would not allow you to ignore it, since it isn’t text on the location, it’s text on a card attached to the location.

Third and finally, taking the wording of [Read the Signs](/card/06117) into account are we now to understand Haunted to be a keyword that *triggers* in St.6 but in fact sets up a delayed effect that resolves at a later timing point? Otherwise I'm unsure how Read the Signs is supposed to ignore Haunted (which is its traditionally understood use case.) **A:** 1) Neither Rain nor Snow can cancel Alert/Retaliate (and Haunted), treating all as “effects of the failed skill test.” 2) If playing Live and Learn, Alert/Retaliate would have resolved already during Step 7 of the initial test, as “effects of the failed test.” 3) Yes, Read the Signs was always intended to be able to ignore Haunted, a “keyword on your location that would trigger during this investigation.” 4) There is also no mechanical difference between “effects of the failed test” and “effects from the failed test.”",

This raises three questions. First: what is the exact timing of the resolution of Alert et al. and do other effects have priority over them? Specifically, is [Live and Learn](/card/04200) resolved before or after resolving attacks/haunted effects?

The latter has traditionally been assumed to allow the committer to resolve effects like Alert etc. rather than the performing investigator but this ruling makes that murkier and calls into question the intended use case of that skill. Third and finally, taking the wording of [Read the Signs](/card/06117) into account are we now to understand Haunted to be a keyword that *triggers* in St.6 but in fact sets up a delayed effect that resolves at a later timing point? Otherwise I'm unsure how Read the Signs is supposed to ignore Haunted (which is it's traditionally understood use case.) **A:** 1) Neither Rain nor Snow can cancel Alert/Retaliate (and Haunted), treating all as “effects of the failed skill test.” 2) If playing Live and Learn, Alert/Retaliate would have resolved already during Step 7 of the initial test, as “effects of the failed test.” 3) Yes, Read the Signs was always intended to be able to ignore Haunted, a “keyword on your location that would trigger during this investigation.” 4) There is also no mechanical difference between “effects of the failed test” and “effects from the failed test.”",

Cards may still be committed to the test, and the investigator’s total modified skill value is still determined, as it may have some bearing on other card abilities.

Previously, if I had an ally in play and wanted to play an ally, I would first have to discard that ally because I was “at my slot limit” for allies. With the new rule, I only have to discard the ally that is in play if playing a new ally would put me above my slot limit.

If you declare you’re going to trigger [Olive McBride's](/card/04197) ability first, you should then declare which of the 3 tokens you’re about to reveal from Olive’s ability will be turned into 2 tokens from the [Grotesque Statue](/card/01071) (For example, “I’m going to reveal 3 tokens using Olive, and for the first token, I’m going to reveal 2 instead of 1 using my statue). Then you’ll ignore one of the 2 statue tokens, and be left with 3 total tokens, which you’ll then ignore 1 of. (All of these tokens are considered to be revealed simultaneously, so you are not allowed to reveal the\nfirst 2 tokens with Olive, and then decide whether or not to use the statue). \nIf you instead trigger the statue’s ability first, you would do the same thing, declaring your intent. (For example, “I’m going to reveal 2 tokens using my statue, but for the second token, I’m going to use Olive’s ability to reveal 3 instead of 1”.) Then you would choose between resolving the first token or the 3 Olive tokens. (Here this may seem a little strange, because Grotesque Statue says “Choose 1 of those tokens to resolve, and ignore the other,” which implies that you only get to resolve 1 token and ignore 1 token, but for the purposes of resolving these types of effects, the 3 tokens revealed from Olive’s ability should be treated as 1 revealed token.)

If so, is there any limit to how many times you can trigger Yaotl's ability (i.e. is there any limit to how many cards you can discard outside of players' turns)?",
                "answer": "If a card has a limit which specifies a particular period of time (such as a phase or a turn), it can only be activated during that period. For example, if a card had a limit of “once per phase,” then it can only be activated during a phase, and not outside of a phase or in between two phases. In the case of Yaotl, his ability can only be activated during an investigator’s turn. <"

Is this intended to be read as a blanket prohibition on spending any xp at all, or just a prohibition on the xp earned from that particular scenario? The exact wording is that we will be instructed to spend \"this experience\" at a later time, which seems to imply only the particular scenario's xp is locked away (as opposed to banked experience from a previous scenario, In The Thick of It, etc.) However, an email ruling from MJ seems to imply there is a total experience-spending lockout. Furthermore, even if there is a total prohibition on spending any xp after these scenarios, is it still possible to upgrade my deck by spending 0xp? For example, if my deck contained x2 [Arcane Research](/card/04109), then upgrading one copy of [Rite of Seeking](/card/01689) from level 0 to level 2 would cost 0xp, which seemingly would not violate even a total ban on spending xp.",

For example, when applying chaos symbol effects during Step 4 of a skill test or applying modifiers to an investigator’s skill value during Step 5 of a skill test, the effects and modifiers of all of the resolved chaos tokens should be applied, even though the rules state “the revealed chaos token.” Similarly, any card effects that refer to “the revealed chaos token” refer to all of the\nresolved tokens. For example: An investigator plays [Premonition](/card/04199) , which reads: “Put Premonition into play, reveal a random chaos token from the chaos bag, and seal it on Premonition.” That investigator then uses [Olive McBride](/card/04197) to “reveal 3 chaos tokens instead of 1, choose 2 of those tokens to resolve, and ignore the other.” In this case, both of the resolved tokens would be sealed on Premonition, even though Premonition only refers to the revealed token as\na singular token. Likewise, when Premonition instructs that investigator to “Resolve the token sealed here as if it were just revealed from the chaos bag,” the investigator should resolve both of the tokens sealed on it. Additionally, when resolving multiple chaos tokens, any game or card effects which trigger if a certain chaos token is revealed—such as the text “If the named chaos token is revealed during this skill test…” on [Recall the Future](/card/04158)—will trigger if any of the resolved chaos tokens meet the specified conditions. Such an effect will not trigger twice if two of the designated tokens are resolved.\nNote that this entry only applies when multiple chaos tokens are “resolved.” If multiple chaos tokens are revealed and all but 1 of them are canceled or ignored, this entry does not apply. -",

Then you’ll ignore one of the 2 statue tokens, and be left with 3 total tokens, which you’ll then ignore 1 of.

Then you would choose between resolving the first token or the 3 Olive tokens. (Here this may seem a little strange, because Grotesque Statue says “Choose 1 of those tokens to resolve, and ignore the other,” which implies that you only get to resolve 1 token and ignore 1 token, but for the purposes of resolving these types of effects, the 3 tokens revealed from Olive’s ability should be treated as 1 revealed token.)

That ruling is specifically talking about effects within another ability that trigger if a chaos token is revealed, such as the horror-dealing effect on [Shrivelling](/card/01060).

For example, when applying chaos symbol effects during Step 4 of a skill test or applying modifiers to an investigator’s skill value during Step 5 of a skill test, the effects and modifiers of all of the resolved chaos tokens should be applied, even though the rules state “the revealed chaos token.” Similarly, any card effects that refer to “the revealed chaos token” refer to all of the\nresolved tokens. For example: An investigator plays [Premonition](/card/04199) , which reads: “Put Premonition into play, reveal a random chaos token from the chaos bag, and seal it on Premonition.” That investigator then uses [Olive McBride](/card/04197) to “reveal 3 chaos tokens instead of 1, choose 2 of those tokens to resolve, and ignore the other.” In this case, both of the resolved tokens would be sealed on Premonition, even though Premonition only refers to the revealed token as\na singular token. Likewise, when Premonition instructs that investigator to “Resolve the token sealed here as if it were just revealed from the chaos bag,” the investigator should resolve both of the tokens sealed on it. Additionally, when resolving multiple chaos tokens, any game or card effects which trigger if a certain chaos token is revealed—such as the text “If the named chaos token is revealed during this skill test…” on [Recall the Future](/card/04158)—will trigger if any of the resolved chaos tokens meet the specified conditions. Such an effect will not trigger twice if two of the designated tokens are resolved.\nNote that this entry only applies when multiple chaos tokens are “resolved.” If multiple chaos tokens are revealed and all but 1 of them are canceled or ignored, this entry does not apply. -",

This raises three questions. First: what is the exact timing of the resolution of Alert et al. and do other effects have priority over them? Specifically, is [Live and Learn](/card/04200) resolved before or after resolving attacks/haunted effects?

Third and finally, taking the wording of [Read the Signs](/card/06117) into account are we now to understand Haunted to be a keyword that *triggers* in St.6 but in fact sets up a delayed effect that resolves at a later timing point? Otherwise I'm unsure how Read the Signs is supposed to ignore Haunted (which is it's traditionally understood use case.) **A:** 1) Neither Rain nor Snow can cancel Alert/Retaliate (and Haunted), treating all as “effects of the failed skill test.” 2) If playing Live and Learn, Alert/Retaliate would have resolved already during Step 7 of the initial test, as “effects of the failed test.” 3) Yes, Read the Signs was always intended to be able to ignore Haunted, a “keyword on your location that would trigger during this investigation.” 4) There is also no mechanical difference between “effects of the failed test” and “effects from the failed test.”",

Your question sparked a conversation about ways we might expand the standard Setup and where cards that “begin the game” would actually be put into play, or at least what step they would be set aside at.

If a cultist or lunatic is handcuffed they cannot ready, but they might be the only cultist or lunatic in play. Are those cards effectively negated?",
                "answer": "As for Mysterious Chanting and Dance of the Yellow King, the answer is… sort of. Mysterious Chanting simply adds doom to the nearest Cultist, so if the nearest Cultist is handcuffed, then yes, it will do nothing. Dance of the Yellow King is trickier. It reads: “… If you fail, the nearest Lunatic enemy readies, moves (one location at a time) until it reaches your location, engages you, and makes an immediately attack.” Technically, the movement, engagement and attack aspects of this effect are not dependent on the enemy readying. While typically only ready enemies can move, engage, or attack, there is no rule stopping them from doing so while exhausted if an effect explicitly instructs them to. So strange as it may seem, if the nearest Lunatic enemy is handcuffed, it won’t ready, but it will still move to you, engage you, and attack. (Note that this would be different if the effect used the word “then” somewhere in it, for example “readies, then moves…”)"

In other words, if a 4 shroud location has [Obscuring Fog](/card/01168) and [The Skeleton Key](/card/04270) attached to it, its shroud would still be 1, no matter what, because The Skeleton Key sets its value to 1. It is worth noting that this answer would be different if it set its \"base\" value – the \"base\" value of something is the value before modifiers are applied, so that would allow it to be modified afterward.

The real question is: when does the committed card enter or leave play? Generally speaking, cards placed beneath other cards (such as the card beneath Amanda Sharpe) are out of play. Cards committed to tests never\nreally \"enter play,\" but while they are committed to a test, their icons are added to the investigator’s relevant skill and their text is active. So, while the card beneath Amanda is committed to a test, its icons and text should be alterable by game effects (as if you had committed it from your hand), just like any other in-play card. But as soon as that test ends, it returns to its out-of-play state, and any lasting effects would drop. TL;DR: The bonus icon granted by Grisly Totem would only apply for the\ntest during which Grisly Totem is used, after which the card returns to its out-of-play state, and the bonus icon would drop. -"

                "question": "I have several questions about Concealed today, gathered from several people who have encountered confusion while playing The Scarlet Keys. 1) To what extent are effects on cards replaced by exposing a concealed mini-card (henceforth referred to as just \"exposure\" or \"exposing\")? For example, if I use [Breaking and Entering](/card/07114) to discover a clue and automatically evade an enemy, can a discover a clue and use the automatic evade to expose? Or automatically evade an actual enemy that happens to be engaged with me, and replace the clue discovery with exposure? The rules state that \"all effects\" of the ability that performs exposure are replaced by exposure, but the examples only seem to show instances where individual effects are replaced, not multiple effects. 2) Similarly, if I investigate with [Thieves' Kit](/card/09064) to expose, is the resource I gain from a successful investigation also replaced by exposure? 3) The rules state that an effect that deals 3 damage to every enemy at a location cannot do multiple exposures; only one mini-card can be exposed by any ability. However, can such an effect still deal damage to enemies at the location, as well as exposing a mini-card? 4) Suppose [Trish Scarborough](/card/07003) is at a location with solely a concealed mini-card. After she discovers 1 or more clues, can she trigger her ability, and use the automatic evasion that results to expose? Can she use the \"discover 1 additional clue\" option to expose? The straightforward answer would appear to be \"no\", since she is not at a location with an enemy, but it's slightly ambiguous because automatic evasion can be performed on mini-cards as if they were engaged enemies, so that might let her ability trigger. 5) Suppose Trish is at a location where she is engaged with an enemy, and there is also a concealed mini-card at that location. Now that there is an enemy, her ability can definitely trigger no matter what (and if there was a clue there, she could definitely replace the clue discovery option with an exposure). However, if there were no clues at the location, could she use the automatic evasion option of her ability to expose? Or can the automatic evasion only target \"that enemy\" (i.e. the actual enemy engaged with her).",

                "question": "I have several questions about Concealed today, gathered from several people who have encountered confusion while playing The Scarlet Keys. 1) To what extent are effects on cards replaced by exposing a concealed mini-card (henceforth referred to as just \"exposure\" or \"exposing\")? For example, if I use [Breaking and Entering](/card/07114) to discover a clue and automatically evade an enemy, can a discover a clue and use the automatic evade to expose? Or automatically evade an actual enemy that happens to be engaged with me, and replace the clue discovery with exposure? The rules state that \"all effects\" of the ability that performs exposure are replaced by exposure, but the examples only seem to show instances where individual effects are replaced, not multiple effects. 2) Similarly, if I investigate with [Thieves' Kit](/card/09064) to expose, is the resource I gain from a successful investigation also replaced by exposure? 3) The rules state that an effect that deals 3 damage to every enemy at a location cannot do multiple exposures; only one mini-card can be exposed by any ability. However, can such an effect still deal damage to enemies at the location, as well as exposing a mini-card? 4) Suppose [Trish Scarborough](/card/07003) is at a location with solely a concealed mini-card. After she discovers 1 or more clues, can she trigger her ability, and use the automatic evasion that results to expose? Can she use the \"discover 1 additional clue\" option to expose? The straightforward answer would appear to be \"no\", since she is not at a location with an enemy, but it's slightly ambiguous because automatic evasion can be performed on mini-cards as if they were engaged enemies, so that might let her ability trigger. 5) Suppose Trish is at a location where she is engaged with an enemy, and there is also a concealed mini-card at that location. Now that there is an enemy, her ability can definitely trigger no matter what (and if there was a clue there, she could definitely replace the clue discovery option with an exposure). However, if there were no clues at the location, could she use the automatic evasion option of her ability to expose? Or can the automatic evasion only target \"that enemy\" (i.e. the actual enemy engaged with her).<br>",

Word of Weal instructs the player to \"Add your will to your skill value for this test\". This is notably distinct from a Circle test, which inherently changes the nature of the test to one that tests multiple skills at once. So, if Amina uses Word of Weal on a will test (from say, [Rite of Seeking](/card/01689) that has a doom on her from her play ability), she tests at 3 + 3 = 6 by default. What happens if: 1) She commits [Guts](/card/01089) to the test. Does she test at (3+2) + (3+2) = 10? Or (3+3) + 2 = 8? 2) She uses [High Roller](/card/04156) on the test (it could be [Teamwork'd](/card/02018) over). Again, does she test at 10 or 8? 3) She commits nothing to the test and does not modify her skill value in any way before drawing a token, testing at 6, and then draws a -1 token. Is her result (3",

However, Supernatural Record reads: \"When you play The Raven Quill, instead of attaching it to a named asset you control, you may search your deck, discard pile, and hand for a copy of a named asset and play it (paying its cost). Then, attach The Raven Quill to it.\" Which sounds like it replaces (using \"instead\") the attach-on-play effect with a procedure that first performs a tutor, then attaches Raven Quill to the tutored asset. Thus, is it possible that with Supernatural Record, a second Raven Quill can be played so as to resolve the tutoring effect, after which the attachment fails? After all, the rules only prohibit a second copy of a unique card from being brought \"into play\", so in theory a Raven Quill with Supernatural Record avoids being brought \"into play\" until after the tutoring effect is resolved and it attempts to attach to an asset. On the other hand, even with Supernatural Record the original text of Raven Quill that states \"Attach to a named asset you control.\" still exists. In some sense, then, it's still an attach-on-play event, and it's possible that the rules for Play Restrictions (which state you must check for legality before playing the card) prevent a second Raven Quill from coming in at all because it's still a unique card that attempts to come into play through attachment. **A:** No, you cannot attempt to play a second The Raven Quill if there is already one The Raven Quill in play, even if you have the Supernatural Record upgrade.",

If Deduction doesn't work for Telescanner discovering clues at different locations, then it seems to me that it shouldn't work for Seeking Answers discovering clues at different locations. Can you please comment on how Deduction does (or doesn't) work with Seeking Answers? **A:** Thank you for bringing that ruling to our attention, because we did not consider it when making the ruling on Hyperphysical Shotcaster. After much discussion we believe that the ruling for Deduction + Seeking Answers is the same ruling we’d want to make for Deduction + Hyperphysical Shotcaster: when you investigate with the Shotcaster’s Telescanner form and commit Deduction to that test, you would be able to discover 1 clue at “any (other) revealed location” and 1 clue at your location if successful.",

According to the rules reference, under [Campaign Play](/rules#Campaign_Play), experience is spent and decks are upgraded \"After recording the results of a scenario\". There is also a clause that reads \"The above processes, and any specific instructions provided by the campaign guide, are the only methods by which a player may modify his or her deck during a campaign.\" Taken together, the implication would seem to be that the point immediately after a scenario is the only instance in which experience can be spent. However, in The Scarlet Keys, experience is frequently gained from interludes between scenarios, sometimes on multiple occasions. And there is a possibility that experience can be gained after the penultimate scenario, but before the final scenario. If experience spending is strictly restricted to the window after finishing a scenario, then such experience would be effectively lost (unless the investigators are carried over to a new campaign, but that is well known to be a niche playstyle). So, is experience spending strictly restricted to the window after finishing a scenario, or can we effectively spend experience whenever we want?",

                "question": "I had a question regarding effects that \"cancel all effects of cards committed to this skill test\" which arise in both [Where Doom Awaits](/card/02274) and [Sanguine Shadows](/card/09545). Specifically are there any skill effects not cancelled by these effects? My primary confusion results from cards like [On the Mend](/card/09006). If On The Mend's **Forced** effect is also cancelled is it discarded instead of being returned to Vincent's set aside area? If so and Vincent shuffles his discard into his deck how should the Limit 1 in hand be resolved if he attempts to draw a copy of On the Mend when one is already there? Similarly for things like [Unrelenting](/card/07196), is the text that returns the sealed tokens at test end canceled? Does it matter because the default rules for seal would resolve at that time?",
                "answer": "We reviewed the scenario cards in question and we will plan to address them in the next FAQ, either with errata or with additional clarification. We believe that, when a scenario card such as Where Doom Awaits states to “cancel the effects and icons” of committed skill cards, this only applies to non-weakness skill cards and only lasts until Step 7 of that skill test. This should clarify our intentions for such a scenario. This should allow for On the Mend to be returned to hand as intended instead of discarded, and for Weakness skill cards such as [Dreams of the Deep](/card/98015) to function as intended. As for Unrelenting, there is already a rule in place that if a card with sealed tokens leaves play, those tokens are immediately released, so the tokens would still be returned even if the card’s effects were canceled during the test."

                "question": "In the case where the cultists accumulate sufficient clues to advance Act 2a due to the effect on Agenda 1b that instructs players to either spawn ***Cultists*** or place clues on the story card: does the resolution of agenda 1b \"pause\" while Act 2a advances to Act 2b? This is important because Act 2b has effects that depend on the difference in clues between the cultists and the players; if agenda 1b does not \"pause\", the cultists gain many more clues or spawn many more enemies, and [The Chase](/card/09570) becomes much more difficult. If agenda 1b does \"pause\", Act 2b further instructs us to advance both the act and agenda directly to \"The Chase\". Does that mean the remaining resolution of agenda 1b is halted? Or do we continue spawning enemies until we run out of enemies? (The story card is flipped during the chase, so we can no longer spawn clues). Finally, in general, when ***Cultists*** spawn due to the effect on agenda 1b, are they considered to have the Concealed keyword, even though agenda 1a (which grants them that keyword) is out of play while agenda 1b is resolving?",
                "answer": "If Agenda 1b placed enough clues for Act 2a to flip, you would “pause” resolving Agenda 1b, then resolve Act 2b in full, then finish resolving Agenda 1b. Only after all of that would you have [The Chase](/card/09570) in play as the active Agenda & Act card."

Since Agenda 1a is not in play while doing this, ***Cultist*** enemies do not have concealed 1 and thus you draw them normally. This specific interaction already happened in Miskatonic Museum and the Return To had to add a rule so that the text on the next agenda is still in play while resolving the b side of all agendas because this was the intent for this scenario. So my question is: Is this the intent for the cultist to be drawn normally or an oversight and cultists should still have concealed 1?",
